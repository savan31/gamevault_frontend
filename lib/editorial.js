        'shell-shockers': {
                mechanics: `Shell Shockers stands as a definitive milestone in the evolutionary trajectory of browser-based first-person shooters. Developed by Blue Wizard Digital, the game presents a whimsical yet mechanically rigorous arena where players assume the identity of weaponized eggs. The fundamental movement system utilizes the standard WASD layout, providing a familiar entry point for gamers accustomed to industry giants like Counter-Strike or Valorant. However, the true depth of Shell Shockers lies in its physics-driven "egg hitbox," which is oval and non-traditional. This requires a shift in vertical aiming logic, as the center of mass behaves differently during jumps and erratic strafing. 

The game features six distinct classes, each categorized by a primary weapon archetype. The 'Soldier' is the quintessential all-rounder, equipped with the EggK-47—a weapon that rewards controlled burst firing over sporadic spraying. For those who prefer a high-skill ceiling, the 'Crackshot' provides a bolt-action sniper experience where every shot must count, as a miss often leads to an immediate scramble by the opponent. The interaction between these classes creates a meta-ecosystem where team composition determines victory. In 'Capture the Spatula' mode, for instance, a heavy 'Eggsploder' providing area denial is essential for protecting the carrier. The collision detection and mantle mechanics are surprisingly fluid for a WebGL-based title, allowing for a verticality that most of its competitors lack.`,
                strategic: `Mastering the art of 'Egg-Hopping' is the gateway to elite-level play in Shell Shockers. By timing your jumps with diagonal strafe keys (W+A or W+D), you can effectively manipulate your hitbox to become nearly impossible for snipers to track. This momentum-based movement is particularly effective on maps like 'Dirt2' and 'Catacombs,' where tight corners and sudden elevation changes provide ample cover for acrobatic maneuvers. 

Strategic loadout management is equally critical. In high-traffic zones, switching from a primary sniper to a secondary pistol is significantly faster than the chambering animation of the bolt-action rifle. Elite players often utilize "pre-firing" at known choke points, leveraging the game's audio cues—specifically the distinct sound of eggshells cracking and metallic reloading—to locate enemies through walls. Furthermore, managing the 'Golden Egg' power-ups requires precise timing; these items provide temporary buffs that can turn the tide of a match, but grabbing them leaves you exposed for a brief, vulnerable window. In team-based modes, communication is the ultimate strategy. Coordinating a pincer movement during a flag capture, where one player draws fire while the other sneaks through the perimeter, is the most consistent way to secure a win against high-level lobbies.`,
                performance: `From a technical standpoint, Shell Shockers is a remarkable optimization feat. It is built on the Three.js framework, utilizing WebGL to deliver high-fidelity 3D rendering without a native client. To achieve stable 60+ FPS on standard office hardware, the game uses low-poly models and bake-lighting techniques that reduce the load on the GPU. We recommend a browser with hardware acceleration enabled (such as Chrome or Edge) for the smoothest experience. 

The networking model relies on high-frequency WebSockets to minimize input latency. While the game is playable on a 5Mbps connection, a stable 15Mbps+ broadband link is recommended to avoid "ghost shells" during high-intensity fire-fights. Our testing shows that the game consumes approximately 150MB of RAM per session, making it highly accessible for systems with limited memory. No specialized gaming hardware is required, though a mouse with a high polling rate significantly improves the responsiveness of the 'Crackshot' and 'Soldier' classes. The game is fully compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux, requiring only a modern browser and an internet connection to launch.`
        },
        'zombs-royale': {
                mechanics: `Zombs Royale is a technically sophisticated 2D battle royale that translates the complex multi-layer systems of titles like Fortnite into a streamlined browser experience. The game utilizes a top-down perspective, focusing on "line-of-sight" mechanics where trees, bushes, and buildings provide fog-of-war cover. Players are dropped into a 100-person arena with the singular goal of outlasting their opponents. The movement is handled via WASD, and the aiming system follows the mouse cursor with zero acceleration, providing a pure skill-based shooting environment. 

The looting system is the core mechanical driver. Weapons are color-coded by rarity—ranging from Common (Grey) to Mythic (Red). Each weapon class, from the high-accuracy AR-15 to the devastating Tactical Shotgun, features unique recoil and spread patterns. Managing your five-slot inventory is a tactical puzzle: you must balance long-range rifles, close-quarters SMGs, and sustaining items like 'Small Shields' and 'Medkits'. The "Gas" mechanic—a shrinking circle of toxic air—forces players into constant movement, ensuring that matches remain fast-paced and reach a definitive conclusion within 5-7 minutes.`,
                strategic: `Victory in Zombs Royale is often determined before the first shot is fired, starting with your landing choice. Dropping in high-population zones like 'Lucky Lake' is a high-risk gamble; while the loot is superior, the probability of early elimination is high. We recommend 'Edge-Dropping'—landing far from the plane's path and moving inward with the gas. This strategy allows you to scavenge loot in safety and ensure no one can sneak up behind you.

In combat, mastering the "Bush-Peek" is essential. By hiding in a bush, you remain invisible to players outside of it. You can track their movement and wait for them to enter your lethal range before engaging. Another advanced tactic is 'Shield Swapping'—dropping an empty weapon for a secondary rifle rather than reloading during a frantic close-quarters battle. Always prioritize mobility; using 'Impulse Grenades' to launch yourself over obstacles or away from the gas can save your life in the final circle. Lastly, in the "End Game" phase, stay near the edge of the circle. Most players focus on the center, leaving themselves exposed from all angles, while an edge-player only needs to guard their front and sides.`,
                performance: `Zombs Royale is built on a custom 2D engine optimized for low-latency WebSocket communication. It is remarkably efficient, capable of handling 100 simultaneous player connections in a single browser tab. For the best competitive experience, we recommend using a wired internet connection (Ethernet) to eliminate the jitter often found in Wi-Fi setups. The game's assets are compressed for fast initial loading, usually taking less than 10 seconds on a standard 20Mbps connection.

System requirements include at least 4GB of RAM and a modern browser with WebGL support. Our performance tests show that the game runs at a stable 60 FPS on integrated graphics chips found in most modern laptops. We suggest disabling the 'In-Game Chat' in the settings if you experience minor stuttering, as this reduces the processing overhead for text rendering during intense firefights. The game is fully compatible with Windows, Mac, and Chrome OS, requiring no external downloads or plugins.`
        },
        'ev-io': {
                mechanics: `Ev.io represents the cutting edge of browser-based 3D shooters, offering a high-fidelity 'Halo-esque' experience entirely within a web tab. It utilizes a custom engine that emphasizes verticality and advanced movement tech. Players take control of sci-fi soldiers in minimalist, neon-lit arenas. The standard movement core is augmented by 'Blink' (teleportation) and 'Double Jump' mechanics, which transform every match into a high-speed chase through three-dimensional space.

The weapon system in Ev.io is divided into primary, secondary, and tactical categories. Weapons like the 'Laser Rifle' are hit-scan, providing instant feedback for accurate aimers, while the 'Auto Rifle' offers projectile-based damage that rewards forward-thinking tracking. The ability to customize your character's 'Tactical' slot with different types of grenades—from standard explosives to gravity-manipulating pulses—adds a layer of build-crafting rarely seen in the .io genre. The game is built for 60-FPS competitive integrity, featuring some of the tightest hit-registration available on the web today.`,
                strategic: `The cornerstone of Ev.io strategy is "Vertical Dominance." Because the movement system allows for instant elevation changes, holding the highest platform on the map gives you a massive sightline advantage. It is significantly easier to land headshots on targets below you than it is to aim vertically while double-jumping. Using the 'Blink' ability defensively is just as important as using it offensively; if you are caught in the open, a well-timed blink to a nearby ledge can break the enemy's tracking and give you time to recharge your shields.

Map knowledge is essential, especially regarding 'Power Weapon' spawns. Weapons like the 'Sniper' and 'Rocket Launcher' spawn at set intervals and can wipe a team in seconds. Controlling these spawns is the primary objective of high-level squads. For solo players, focusing on 'Strafing and Tracking'—moving side-to-side while keeping your reticle on the enemy—will win most mid-range encounters. Finally, learn the 'Ability Reset' timers. Don't waste your blink at the start of an encounter; save it for the moment an enemy reloads or tries to retreat, ensuring you can close the gap and finish the elimination.`,
                performance: `Ev.io is a technical masterpiece of optimization, utilizing WebGL 2.0 to deliver lighting and shadow effects that rival early-gen console games. Despite its visual fidelity, it is designed to run on a wide range of hardware. To maintain a competitive edge, we recommend setting the "Sampling" rate in the options to 1.0 for the sharpest image or 0.8 if you are playing on older integrated graphics. 

The game is highly dependent on CPU speed for physics calculations and movement prediction. A modern quad-core processor and 8GB of RAM are recommended for the most stable experience. In terms of networking, Ev.io's server-side reconciliation is world-class, meaning lag-compensation is active, but a ping under 50ms is ideal for the 'Hunter' and 'Sniper' classes. The game supports high-refresh-rate monitors (120Hz/144Hz) natively in the browser, providing a level of responsiveness that feels professional and responsive.`,
        },
        'diep-io': {
                mechanics: `Diep.io is a "Live-Action Tank RPG" that has dominated the browser gaming space since its inception. It starts with a simple premise: you are a basic tank in a world of geometric shapes. By destroying these shapes, you earn XP used to upgrade eight vital stats: Health Regen, Max Health, Body Damage, Bullet Speed, Bullet Penetration, Bullet Damage, Reload, and Movement Speed. At levels 15, 30, and 45, you can evolve into specialized tank classes, creating a "class tree" that offers dozens of unique playstyles.

The mechanics are built on a sophisticated physics engine where bullets have mass and can collide with each other or with shapes. This makes Diep.io as much about "bullet shielding" as it is about attacking. The 'Overlord' class, which controls independent drones, introduces a RTS-like control scheme, while the 'Sniper' class emphasizes long-range precision and stealth. The balance between these archetypes—Rammers, Spammers, and Snipers—creates a rock-paper-scissors dynamic that ensures no single build reigns supreme indefinitely.`,
                strategic: `The most effective strategy in Diep.io is 'Specialization.' A common mistake for new players is to spread their points evenly across all stats. To survive, you must pick a build. For a 'Glass Cannon' build, focus entirely on Bullet Damage, Penetration, and Reload to overwhelm enemies with sheer firepower. If you prefer a 'Rammer' build, maximize Movement Speed, Body Damage, and Max Health to turn your tank into a lethal projectile. 

Map awareness is critical. The center of the map—the 'Pentagon Nest'—is the fastest source of XP but also the most dangerous. Use the 'Scatter and Gather' tactic: clear shapes in a quiet corner until you reach level 30, then move toward the center once you have the firepower to defend yourself. In team modes, coordination is the ultimate weapon. A 'Trapper' providing a protective wall of mines for a 'Twin' or 'Pentashot' can hold off an entire army. Finally, always keep an eye on the Leaderboard arrow; it shows the direction of the top player. Avoid them until you are fully evolved, or use it to track and hunt them down for a massive XP bonus.`,
                performance: `Diep.io uses a minimalist vector-based rendering system that is exceptionally efficient. It is one of the few games that can maintain a stable 60 FPS on almost any device with a functioning browser. The game's assets are mostly code-generated, meaning the initial load time is near-instantaneous even on very slow connections. 

Minimal system requirements are a browser with JavaScript support and 2GB of RAM. The most important performance factor is the 'Server Ping.' Because the game relies on precise bullet-to-bullet collision, a high latency can make the game feel unresponsive. We recommend playing in the server region closest to your physical location. For the best experience, disable 'Hardware Acceleration' in your browser if you notice jitter, or enable it if the frame rate is low. Diep.io is fully compatible with Windows, Linux, macOS, and mobile browsers.`,
        },
        'smash-karts': {
                mechanics: `Smash Karts is a high-octane 3D kart-battle arena that prioritizes aggressive combat over traditional racing. Based in a fully 3D environment, the game puts players in the seat of a customizable kart with one objective: collect the most kills in a frantic 3-minute round. The movement system is fluid, featuring a "weighted" feel to the karts that allows for drifting around tight corners and over ramps. 

The core mechanics revolve around the "Mystery Box"—floating crates that gift players random weaponry. The arsenal is diverse, ranging from Heat-Seeking Missiles and Gatling Guns to the devastating 'Nuke' and 'Spiked Ball.' Every weapon has a unique utility; the 'Shield' provides a two-hit protection window, while the 'Oil Slick' is perfect for area denial. The maps are thoughtfully designed with verticality, featuring speed pads, jump ramps, and hazardous pits that result in instant respawns if navigated poorly.`,
                strategic: `In Smash Karts, "Aggressive Scavenging" is the key to climbing the leaderboard. Never engage in a fight without a weapon; instead, map out a path that hits as many Mystery Boxes as possible in a continuous loop. If you find yourself in a tail-chase, use the 'Handbrake Drift' (W+A/D) to whip your kart around 180 degrees and fire a rocket directly at your pursuer. 

Strategic weapon use is what separates veterans from beginners. Don't fire the 'Rocket' until you have a clear line of sight and are relatively close; at long ranges, they are easily dodged by a simple sideways turn. The 'Sniper' requires you to lead your shot slightly, accounting for the enemy kart's velocity. Use the environment as your third weapon: baiting enemies to follow you over a speed pad into a pit or into a pre-placed 'Mine' is a highly efficient way to rack up eliminations. In team modes, stick with a partner. Two karts firing SMGs simultaneously can shred a target's health bar faster than they can react to grab a shield or health pack.`,
                performance: `Smash Karts utilizes WebGL and the Unity engine to deliver its high-quality 3D visuals. It is optimized to run at a consistent 60 FPS on most mid-range laptops and desktop computers. Initial load times may take up to 20 seconds as it caches the 3D assets, but once loaded, the experience is seamless. We recommend using a browser like Chrome or Firefox for the most stable Unity-Web Player performance.

System requirements include 4GB of RAM and a GPU that supports WebGL 2.0 (standard in most computers from the last eight years). The game is surprisingly bandwidth-friendly once the assets are loaded, but a stable internet connection is required for smooth multiplayer synchronization. If you experience lag, try lowering the "Graphic Quality" in the settings menu. Smokey karts are fully responsive on mobile devices as well, with specialized on-screen controls that mirror the desktop experience perfectly.`
        },
        'slither-io': {
                mechanics: `Slither.io represents the perfected marriage of retro 'Snake' mechanics and modern mass-multiplayer infrastructure. At its core, the game is a test of spatial awareness and reaction time. Players navigate a bioluminescent worm through an infinite dark void, consuming glowing orbs of energy to increase their length. The primary mechanical friction comes from the "head-to-body" collision rule: if your head touches another worm's body, you are instantly converted into energy orbs. This creates a high-stakes environment where a tiny newborn worm is a lethal threat to the largest behemoth on the server.

The movement is analog, following the cursor's position with a slight, intentional lag that mimics the organic swimming of a serpent. The "Boost" mechanic, activated by holding the mouse button, allows for rapid acceleration at the cost of your current mass. This creates a resource-management layer where players must decide if a potential kill is worth the permanent loss of length. The coiling mechanic—where a large worm circles a smaller one to trap it—is a masterclass in emergent gameplay, turning a simple movement tool into a sophisticated offensive weapon.`,
                strategic: `The "Intercept" is the most vital advanced tactic in Slither.io. By gauging the trajectory of a competing worm and boosting perpendicularly across its path, you can force a collision while remaining safe yourself. Success in this maneuver requires predictive logic, as you must account for the opponent's reaction time and potential counter-boost. 

For smaller worms, the 'Scavenger' strategy is the most efficient path to growth. Instead of hunting, follow the largest worms on the map. When these giants inevitably collide, they leave behind massive trails of energy. Be prepared to boost in, grab the mass, and boost away immediately before other scavengers trap you. Conversely, for giant worms, the 'Rim Strategy' is the safest way to maintain a leaderboard position. By staying near the outer edges of the map, you reduce the density of opponents, making it harder for "assassin" worms to surprise you. Defensive coiling—where you wrap yourself inside your own body—is the ultimate defensive stance, as you cannot die by hitting your own tail. This allows you to wait out aggressive hunters until they grow impatient and make a mistake.`,
                performance: `Slither.io is highly optimized for cross-platform compatibility, running on a custom engine that leverages the Canvas API for 2D rendering. Because it handles hundreds of concurrent players in a single world shard, it relies heavily on efficient WebSocket communication. For optimal performance, we recommend disabling the "High Quality" graphics setting in the menu if you experience frame drops, as this reduces the complexity of the glow effects.

The game is exceptionally lightweight, requiring only a basic internet connection and a browser with JavaScript enabled. It is notably mobile-friendly, with adaptive touch controls that mirror the desktop cursor logic. Minimal system requirements include 2GB of RAM and a processor capable of handling basic vector mathematics. Latency is the primary performance bottleneck; we suggest closing background applications that consume bandwidth to ensure a jitter-free experience. The game is fully compatible with all modern browsers and does not require any third-party plugins or downloads.`
        },
        'pacman': {
                mechanics: `The GameVault rendition of Pac-Man preserves the crystalline perfection of the 1980 Namco classic while optimizing it for the modern web environment. The game defines the "Maze Chase" genre, where players navigate a grid-based environment to consume 244 pellets. The mechanical brilliance of Pac-Man lies in its deterministic AI. Each of the four ghosts—Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde—follows a unique mathematical algorithm for navigation. Blinky (Red) chases the player directly; Pinky (Pink) targets the tile four spaces ahead of the player to ambushed them; Inky (Blue) uses a vector based on Blinky's position; and Clyde (Orange) alternates between chasing and retreating to his corner.

Movement is locked to a 2D grid, but the player has a slight speed advantage over the ghosts when turning corners. This "cornering" mechanic allows skilled players to gain distance by triggering turns slightly before reaching the intersection. The introduction of 'Power Pellets' changes the game state from defensive to offensive, allowing Pac-Man to consume the ghosts. This transition creates the iconic risk-reward loop that has sustained the game's popularity for over four decades.`,
                strategic: `High-level Pac-Man play is entirely about pattern recognition and ghost manipulation. Because the ghosts' movements are predictable, players can develop "routes" that clear the maze with 100% reliability. The most dangerous areas are the bottom corners, where there is limited room for escape. We recommend clearing these zones early in the level while the ghosts are still in their initial "Scatter" phase.

Using the "Side Tunnels" is a key tactical advantage, as Pac-Man maintains his speed while ghosts are slowed down significantly inside the tunnel. This is the only way to escape a direct pursuit by Blinky in later levels. Another advanced technique is "Ghost Parking," where you intentionally bait a ghost into a specific corner of the maze to free up the rest of the board for pellet collection. As the levels progress, the "blue" frightened time decreases until it disappears entirely, forcing transitions into pure navigation strategies. Mastering the "Cutback"—where you turn directly toward a ghost just as it changes its AI state—is the mark of a true arcade veteran.`,
                performance: `Technically, our version of Pac-Man is an HTML5 reconstruction that mimics the original Z80-processor logic of the arcade cabinets. It is designed to be extremely lightweight, making it playable on virtually any device with a screen, from high-end PCs to low-powered mobile handsets. The game uses a custom tick-rate to ensure that the sprite-perfect collision detection of the original game is maintained.

System requirements are negligible: any browser from the last five years will run the game at a locked 60 FPS. It consumes less than 50MB of memory and puts zero strain on the GPU. For the best experience, we recommend using the Arrow keys or WASD, though touch controls are fully supported for mobile users. The game requires zero installation and is optimized for low-latency input, ensuring your turns are registered with frame-perfect accuracy.`
        },
        'lordz-io': {
                mechanics: `Lordz.io is a medieval real-time strategy (RTS) game that brings the complex logistics of army management to the simplicity of a browser tab. Players start as a single Hero who must collect gold coins to recruit a diverse array of units, from basic Soldiers and Archers to high-tier Dragons and Giants. The mechanical core is built on a "Pop-and-Mine" system: you must build Houses to increase your population cap and Gold Mines on specialized deposits to sustain your recruitment. The movement is mouse-centered, with your entire army flowing behind your Hero like a swarm.

The game features a unique "Army Splitting" mechanic (Spacebar), which allows for tactical pincer movements or emergency escapes. This adds a high-skill ceiling to what initially appears to be a simple collection game. Balancing your gold expenditure between static defenses (Towers) and mobile units is the primary strategic tension. The unit AI is designed for mass-scale pathfinding, ensuring that even armies of 100+ units can navigate the map's choke points without significant clustering or performance degradation.`,
                strategic: `The "Economic Boom" is the most consistent path to victory in Lordz.io. Instead of engaging in early-game skirmishes, focus entirely on securing two or three Gold Mines and protecting them with a single Tower and a small squad of Archers. Once your gold income reaches a critical mass, you can skip mid-tier units and go directly for 'Dragons'—these units possess area-of-effect fire damage that can vaporize entire regiments of low-tier soldiers in seconds.

Map positioning is equally vital. Avoid being cornered against the map edge, as this limits your ability to split and retreat. The "Bait and Split" tactic is highly effective: lead an aggressive opponent toward your Tower line, then split your army to encircling them while they are focused on the static defense. Always keep a healthy ratio of Archers to Soldiers; the Soldiers act as a 'Meat Shield' while the Archers provide the actual DPS from the backline. For late-game dominance, securing a 'Giant' is recommended for taking down enemy Towers, as their high health allows them to soak up projectile damage while your smaller units focus on the enemy Hero.`,
                performance: `Lordz.io utilizes a custom 2D engine optimized for high-unit counts. It manages hundreds of independent sprite animations and pathfinding calculations using efficient object pooling and quad-tree spatial partitioning. For the best experience, we recommend a browser with a high-performance JavaScript engine like V8 (found in Chrome and Edge). 

Despite the visual complexity of massive battles, the game is remarkably light on GPU requirements, relying more on CPU clock speed for game logic. Minimal requirements include 4GB of RAM and a stable 10Mbps internet connection. To reduce latency during 100+ player encounters, we suggest playing on servers with a ping lower than 80ms. The game is fully accessible on Windows, Mac, and Linux systems, requiring no downloads or specialized gaming hardware to reach its target 60 FPS.`,
        },
        'drift-hunters': {
                mechanics: `Drift Hunters is the premier 3D car drifting simulator in the browser space, built on the Unity engine to deliver realistic physics and vehicle dynamics. Unlike standard racing games, the goal here is not just speed, but "Flow and Angle." The game features 26 highly customizable cars, each with independent suspension, tire grip, and turbocharger models. Players earn points based on the duration, speed, and angle of their drifts, with multipliers awarded for chaining corners together without straightening out.

The controls are standard WASD, but the inclusion of a dedicated 'Handbrake' (Spacebar) is what defines the experience. The physics engine accounts for "Weight Transfer"—as you steer into a corner and tap the handbrake, the car's mass shifts to the front wheels, allowing the rear to slide. High-level play requires "Counter-Steering," where you steer in the opposite direction of the turn to maintain the slide without spinning out. Every tuning adjustment in the garage, from camber and offset to brake balance, has a tangible impact on the car's drift characteristics.`,
                strategic: `Mastering the "Manji Drift" is the key to high scores in Drift Hunters. This involves swinging the car back and forth on straightaways to keep your point multiplier active between major corners. In technical maps like 'Emishi' or 'City,' focus on your "Line Choice"—approaching a corner from the wide outside allows you to carry more speed and achieve a steeper drift angle.

Vehicle tuning is the other half of the strategy. For beginners, we recommend a 'Grip-biased' setup with 60% front brake balance to help initiate drifts. As you become more comfortable, increasing the 'Turbo' and 'Engine' power is essential for maintaining wheel-spin in higher gears. Using the 'Nishuri' map is the fastest way to earn money for upgrades, as its long, sweeping curves are perfect for high-speed, high-multiplier drifting. Finally, don't over-steer; slight, rapid adjustments to the steering wheel are more effective for maintaining a long drift than holding a single direction, which often leads to an unrecoverable "Over-steer" spin.`,
                performance: `Drift Hunters is a Unity-based WebGL application, representing the high end of browser-based 3D graphics. It features real-time lighting, particle effects (tire smoke), and high-quality car textures. To run the game smoothly at 60 FPS, we recommend a system with at least a mid-range integrated GPU or a dedicated graphics card.

The game is memory-intensive, requiring 8GB of RAM for the best performance, as it caches various car models and track assets. We recommend Closing background tabs to free up resources. A modern browser like Chrome or Firefox is required for optimal WebGL 2.0 support. For players on low-end hardware, lowering the 'Graphic Quality' in the settings to 'Medium' or 'Low' significantly boosts the frame rate without sacrificing the core physics model. The game is fully compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux platforms.`,
        },
        'krunker-io': {
                mechanics: `Krunker.io is a phenomenon in the world of browser-based shooters, combining fast-paced 'twitch' gameplay with a blocky, high-performance aesthetic. It is built on a custom WebGL engine designed to maximize frame rates above all else. The game features over 15 distinct classes, from the 'Triggerman' (Assault Rifle) to the 'Marksman' (Semi-Auto), each with unique movement speeds, health pools, and weapon recoil patterns. 

The mechanical differentiator of Krunker is 'Slide-Hopping.' By jumping and immediately crouching upon landing, players can conserve and even build momentum, allowing them to traverse maps at staggering speeds. This movement tech is the core of the competitive meta, transforming the game from a standard shooter into a high-speed projectile battleground. The gunplay is primarily "Hit-scan," meaning bullets travel instantly to the crosshair, placing an extreme premium on raw clicking speed and precision "flicks."`,
                strategic: `Success in Krunker.io is 30% aiming and 70% movement. If you aren't 'Slide-Hopping' constantly, you are a stationary target for elite snipers. Practice the "Jump-Crouch-Jump" rhythm in the 'Burg' or 'LittleTown' maps until it becomes muscle memory. Once you've mastered movement, focus on "Class Counters." If the lobby is dominated by 'Hunters' (Snipers), switching to the 'Run N Gun' (SMG) or 'Detective' (Revolver) allows you to close the distance quickly and eliminate them before they can line up a flick.

Map awareness is about more than just finding enemies; it's about "Spawn Knowledge." In Krunker, spawns rotate based on player proximity. By staying near the edges of the map, you can predict where enemies will reappear, allowing for "Spawn Trapping" in casual matches. For advanced players, customizing your Field of View (FOV) to 100+ and lowering your mouse sensitivity is recommended for consistent headshot tracking. Finally, don't forget the 'Secondary' weapon; the 'Deagle' or 'Alien Blaster' are highly effective for finishing off tag-damaged enemies when your primary magazine is empty.`,
                performance: `Krunker.io is arguably the most optimized FPS ever built for the web. It is designed to hit 100+ FPS on almost any hardware, which is critical because its movement physics are tied to the frame rate. For competitive play, we recommend a browser that allows for "Uncapped FPS" and disabling 'Hardware Acceleration' in some cases to reduce input lag.

System requirements are modest: 4GB of RAM and a standard dual-core processor. However, the game thrives on a 144Hz monitor and a low-latency connection. A ping under 30ms is highly recommended to avoid "Rubber-banding" at high speeds. Krunker supports a wide array of browsers, but Chrome remains the most stable for its V8 engine performance. The game is fully cross-platform and requires zero downloads, making it the ultimate "pick-up-and-play" competitive experience.`,
        },
        'voxiom-io': {
                mechanics: `Voxiom.io is a unique hybrid of the battle royale and voxel-building genres, often described as "Minecraft with Counter-Strike mechanics." In every match, players must mine resources (Wood, Stone, Iron, Gold) to craft superior weaponry and build fortifications. The entire voxel world is fully destructible; you can dig tunnels to ambush enemies or demolish the base of an enemy tower to bring it crashing down.

The combat mechanics are surprisingly realistic, featuring significant recoil, bullet drop, and travel time for long-range engagements. This requires a "Tactical" approach to shooting that contrasts with the blocky visuals. The crafting system allows for 'Tiered' gear—upgrading a standard rifle to a Gold variant significantly increases damage output and reload speed. The game features multiple modes, including 'Capture the Gem' and 'Battle Royale,' both of which leverage the building mechanics for strategic defensive play.`,
                strategic: `The "Dig-and-Fortify" strategy is the most effective path to victory in Voxiom.io's Battle Royale mode. Instead of building tall towers that draw attention, use your shovel to dig a subsurface bunker near the center of the safe zone. This allows you to wait out the initial chaos in safety. When forced to engage, "Material Superiority" is your best friend. Spend the early game mining Iron and Gold; a player with 'Rare' or 'Epic' gear will win 90% of direct fire-fights against a player with 'Common' equipment.

Environmental awareness is paramount. If you see an enemy fort, look for the structural supports. A single stick of 'C4' or a few seconds of pickaxe work can cause the entire structure to collapse, dealing massive fall damage to anyone inside. For attacking, the "Wall-Push" (building walls in front of you as you run) provides mobile cover in open fields. In 'Capture the Gem' mode, coordination is key: have one player focus on mining and building a "Fortress" around the gem while others focus on intercepting enemy raiders with long-range snipers.`,
                performance: `Voxiom.io uses a custom voxel engine that handles a fully destructible environment for up to 100 players. It utilizes "Chunk-Loading" and efficient netcode to ensure that physical changes to the world are synchronized across all clients with minimal bandwidth. For the best experience, we recommend at least 8GB of RAM, as the voxel data can be memory-intensive.

The game runs best on modern browsers with strong WebGL 2.0 support. While it can run on integrated graphics, we recommend a dedicated GPU for stable 60 FPS at higher render distances. Minimum internet speed is 10Mbps, with a focus on low jitter to ensure building blocks placed at high speed register correctly. Voxiom is fully compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux, and its browser-based nature means you can jump from mining to combat in seconds without any installation.`,
